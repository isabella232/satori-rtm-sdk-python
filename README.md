Python SDK for Satori RTM
-------------------------

RTM is the realtime messaging service at the core of the
[Satori platform](https://www.satori.com).

Python SDK makes it more convenient to use Satori RTM
from [Python programming language](https://www.python.org).

# Installation

```
pip install satori-rtm-sdk
```

Secure WebSocket communication (``wss://``) is supported natively
for Python 2.7.9+ and PyPy 2.6+ only.

## Optional dependencies

### backports.ssl

If the SDK installation step detects Python older than 2.7.9 without secure
TLS socket implementation (For example CentOS 7 has Python 2.7.5), it installs
the secure replacement [backports.ssl][1]. Beware that it requires
OpenSSL library, Python development headers and a C compiler to be available.

This should work on CentOS 7:

```
yum install -y epel-release
yum install -y python-pip gcc python-devel openssl-devel
pip install satori-rtm-sdk
```

[1]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/backports.ssl

### rapidjson

The SDK will take advantage of [python-rapidjson][2] for faster json processing
if it's installed.

[2]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-rapidjson

### wsaccel

There are most two notable CPU intensive routines in websocket communication:
UTF-8 validation and payload masking. Fortunately there exists the
[wsaccel package][3] that provides optimized versions of said routines.

To enable the SDK to use wsaccel, use the following code:

```
import satori.rtm.connection
satori.rtm.connection.enable_wsaccel()
```

# Documentation

You can view the latest SDK documentation
[here](https://www.satori.com/docs/rtm-sdks/overview).

# Using https proxy

The SDK supports working through an https (not http) proxy.

When constructing a client using the `Client` constructor or
the `make_client` context manager, add a keyword argument
`https_proxy=(host, port)` like this:

```
with make_client(endpoint, appkey, https_proxy=('127.0.0.1', 4443)) as client:
    print('Connected to Satori RTM through a proxy')
```

# Logging

The SDK uses the standard `logging` module using namespaces `satori.rtm` and
`miniws4py`. If you're writing an application using this SDK, be sure to configure
logging, the simplest way is to do the following at the startup of your application:

```
import logging
logging.basicConfig()
```

If you're writing a library, the best practice is not to configure logging at
all, leaving that for the applications.

# Development

## Development dependencies

There more build-time dependencies than runtime dependencies.
In order to work on satori-rtm-sdk development, you need:

 * [State Machine Compiler (SMC)][4]
    to convert state machines description into Python source code
 * [tox][5]
    to run tests using all supported Python interpreters in separate sandboxes.
 * [pytest][6] (recommended)
    the tests themselves are written only unittest module from stdlib, but using pytest as a runner is more convenient

## Running Tests

Almost all tests are run against real Satori RTM service. The tests require
`credentials.json` file to be populated with RTM credentials. It must include
the following key-value pairs:

```
{
  "endpoint": "YOUR_ENDPOINT",
  "appkey": "YOUR_APPKEY",
  "auth_role_name": "YOUR_ROLE",
  "auth_role_secret_key": "YOUR_SECRET",
  "auth_restricted_channel": "YOUR_RESTRICTED_CHANNEL"
}
```

* `endpoint` is your customer-specific DNS name for RTM access.
* `appkey` is your application key.
* `auth_role_name` is a role name that permits publishing / subscribing to `auth_restricted_channel`. Must be not `default`.
* `auth_role_secret_key` is a secret key for `auth_role_name`.
* `auth_restricted_channel` is a channel with subscribe and publish access for `auth_role_name` role only.

You must use [Dev Portal](https://developer.satori.com/) to create the role and set channel permissions.

After setting up `credentials.json`, run SDK tests with the following commands:

```
export SMC_JAR=/path/to/Smc.jar
tox -e py27-test
```

Substitute `py27` with one of `pypy`, `py34` or `py35` to choose a
desired Python implementation.
